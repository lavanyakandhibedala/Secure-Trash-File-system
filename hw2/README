Mounting:
 1. .sg folder is created while mounting 
 2. key is stored in the sb inode i_private 


First the wrapfs is mounted on ext4 
The following functionalties are done in my assignment:
   1. When we unlink a file without key is just moved to the .sg folder with a different name.
   2. When we unlink a file with an encryption key we encrypt the contents of the file and move it to .sg folder with .enc as the file extension in the end.
   3. when we unlink a file inside the .sg folder it gets permanently unlinked from the .sg folder. 
   4. when we use ./sgctl -u file we undelete the file and place it in the current directory.


Encryption :
   1. while encrypting the file we have a key with which we encrypt the contents of the file and move the file to .sg folder
   2.Using cbc(aes) alloc method we encrypt
Decryption :
   1. using the same key we will decrypt the file when we undelete the file 
   2. this is done using the same key used while encryption

 IOCTL :
   1. undeletes the file and places in the PWD .
   2. decrypts and moves file back if decrypted.
